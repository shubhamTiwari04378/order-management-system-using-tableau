## Problem Statement
You are hired by a chain of online retail stores “Reliant retail limited”. They provided you with
“orders” database and seek answers to the following queries as the results from these queries will
help the company in making data driven decisions that will impact the overall growth of the online
retail store.


## Business Context
This project captures the scenario of simple order management functionality of an online retail
store.
Typical purchase scenario: A customer places an order for N products specifying quantity for each
line item of the order. Every product belongs to a product class (or category). All products ordered
in one order, are shipped to customer’s address (in India or outside) by a shipper in one shipment.
Order can be paid using either Cash, Credit Card or Net Banking.
There can be customers who may not have placed any order. Few customers would have cancelled
their orders (As a whole order, no cancellation of individual item allowed). Few orders may be ‘In
process’ status. There can also be products that were never purchased.
Shippers use optimum sized cartons (boxes) to ship an order, based on the total volume of all
products and their quantities. Dimensions of each product (L, W, H) is also stored in the database. To
keep it simple, all products of an order are put in one single appropriately sized carton for shipping.

## Problem Statement:

Consider that you are a Lead Data Analyst at an Insurance Claims company that has provided you with the Car Insurance Claims dataset. You have been given a task to explore the data, create different plots and interpret useful insights/findings. Your end goal here will be to create a storyboard that you have to present to the Senior Management and the story has to have an end objective and should follow a logical flow to display that you are heading towards achieving the end objective. This will help the Senior Management in taking some decisive actions on the current claims system in place. This storyboard will be an open-ended story for you to explore various different features in the data and try to showcase different plots. Make sure to have minimum clutter in the plots, follow a consistent color scheme across all the plots, and use proper colors to highlight a specific insight. Moreover, your plots on all the dashboards should be interactive and responsive.

## Business Context

We are all aware that accidents are prone everywhere due to negligent driving or climatic conditions. An insurance company always needs to be prepared to estimate the number of accidents and the claims that they can receive at a given point time. Also understanding the pattern of claims would help the companies to frame different types of policies for the users providing better benefits and at the same time increasing the premium to the company.
